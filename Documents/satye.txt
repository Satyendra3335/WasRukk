Subject: Request for Attendance in Research Project and Collaboration with Companies
Respected Sir,
I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to request your permission to be absent from the CS department for three days, from May 16 to May 18, in order to conduct research for my project on waste management. This research aims to explore opportunities for collaboration with various plastics, paper, and other organic waste management companies for the purpose of fair waste trading.
My project focuses on finding sustainable solutions to the growing problem of waste management. I firmly believe that connecting with companies involved in plastics, paper, and organic waste disposal will not only provide valuable insights but also enable us to establish partnerships for waste trade. By selling waste materials to these companies at a fair amount, we can contribute to the circular economy and promote environmental sustainability.
During these three days, I have planned  to visit several local companies in the waste management sector, engage in discussions with their representatives, and explore potential collaboration opportunities. The knowledge and information gathered from these visits will be instrumental in shaping my project and providing practical insights into the industry.I assure you that my absence from the department during these days will not disrupt the ongoing academic activities or research projects. I have made all necessary arrangements to ensure that my responsibilities are taken care of in my absence. Furthermore, I will diligently make up for any missed lectures or coursework upon my return.I kindly request your approval for this short-term absence and provide me with attendance for the dates 16, 17 and 18 I assure you that I will remain committed to the progress of my research project. I will provide a detailed report upon my return, outlining the outcomes of the visits and any potential collaborations established.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly anticipate your positive response to this request and obliged.
Yours sincerely,
Satyendra Singh.
